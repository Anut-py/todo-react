# Todo App
This is a simple todo list application based on the Docker getting-started app.

## Running
To run this, you need (Node JS)[http://www.nodejs.org] installed on your computer.
You can run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the application. Go to (localhost:3000)[http://localhost:3000] to
view the application.

## Editing the app
If you want to edit the app, make some changes to (app.jsx)[./src/app.jsx] and run `npm run compile` to compile the JSX.
If you want Babel to watch for changes to (app.jsx)[./src/app.jsx], run `npm run compile:dev` on the command line.
